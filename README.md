# Create Chrome Browser Extension
**Hi! I am _Aman Raj_. This is a repository where you can learn how to make chrome extension easily.**

<br>

### Prerequisites

<br>

So before we start let's discuss What are the __types of chrome extension__ you can make :
<br>
  * Browser Action - Stay in tool bar accesible all time
  * Page Action - Stay in tool bar but grey-ed out. Accesible only on certain pages.
  * Neither Browser action or Page action. Run in background.
<br>

Extension components are created using these web development technologies :
<br>
  * Manifest ( JSON format )
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * Sometimes bootstrap and jQuery also.

These files combines to make a package of .crx format zip file which can be uploaded to chrome web store.

<br>


### Lest's Begin

> First you have to create a `manifest.json` file. The directory holding the `manifest file` can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state. This file should contain these 4 things : 

 * "name" : tells about name of your extension. 
 * "version" : tells about version of your Extension as you will publish changes later on in future. 
 * "description" : this will be available in discription section in chrome web store. 
 * "manifest_version" : Developers should specify which version of the manifest specification their package targets by setting a manifest_version key in their manifests. 


**manifest.json**

```
{
    "name": "Hello World Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "First chrome extension",
    "manifest_version": 2
}
```

> Secondly create a `popup.html` file. This will give structure to your new static extension. You can add `.css` and `.js` file to make it beutiful and dynamic.


**HTML**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Chrome Extension</title>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h2 id="greet">Hi this is an extension</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS**

```
body {
    background: bisque;
}

h2 {
    color: brown;
}
```

So we have created our first extension and now we want to see how it looks.

Let's see how to run this extension on chrome.

2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to `Developer mode`.
3. Click the `LOAD UNPACKED` button and select the extension directory.

**Congratulations you have just created a basic chrome extension** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ .
